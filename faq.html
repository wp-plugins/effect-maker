  Effect Maker Frequently asked questions
</h3>

<br />
    <h1>Where can I get support?</h1>
    <p>If you have any problems with the software, whether it is the basic or pro version or you just want to give feedback, don't hesitate to contact us at <a href="http://www.mandomartis.com/contact.html" target="helppage2">Mandomartis support</a>. </p>

<h1>I see strange behaviour when inserting the same configuration name into a page several times</h1>
    <p>Only a single configuration name is supported per page. This happens because the function names and variables are named the same in the scripts, thus conflicting with each other. However as a workaround, you can open the configuration in Effect Maker, save it under another name and insert it together with the first configuration, even if you didn't do any changes.</p>
<h1>My images appear strange and too big for the effect</h1>
<p>Make sure that the images you upload are of roughly the same size like the effect area (width and height fields).</p>
    <h1>My image based effect doesn't work</h1>
    <p>Make sure that the images you have specified really exist in your upload folder or image gallery. Some effects (like Image Scroller) crashes if the images don't exist. This could happen if you delete images from your upload folder or image gallery and you have effects that depend on those images.</p>
    <h1>How do I use the effects on my header on the web page or use them in my theme?</h1>
    <p>If you are a more advanced user you can download Effect Maker for Windows or Mac which creates physical .js files for you which you can integrate with your php scripts. Download them from <a href="http://www.effectmaker.com/download.html">here</a>. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>How do I get more effects in my Effect Maker library?</h1>
    <p>If you have the basic edition which is the free, upgrade to the <a href="http://www.mandomartis.com/products.html" target="_blank">pro edition</a> which has many more effects!</p>
